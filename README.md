       ./install.sh

2. install FTDI library

       download FTDI library and copy to $install_dir/ftdi folder
       sudo cp $install_dir/ftdi/build/* /usr/local/lib/
       cd /usr/local/lib/
       sudo ln -s libftd2xx.so.1.x.x libftd2xx.so
       cd $install_dir/bootmode; make
       cd $install_dir/reset; make

       @reboot sudo systemctl restart systemd-udevd; sudo systemctl daemon-reload

4. you can specify target and program name in $install_dir/data/config.txt file.

## Uninstallation
1. delete FTDI library in /usr/local/lib, if necessary
2. delete rule file in /etc/udev/rules.d
3. remove description of "crontab -e", if you input
4. delete all files in $install_dir

## Notes
1. If you want to update Lazurite mini series such as 920J, you need Mini Writer Type A or B.
2. The default location $install_dir is "~/.lazurite/writer".
3. If you want to stop writing program tempolary for some reasons, just delete contents of $install_dir/data/config.txt as empty file.

       cd $install_dir/data/
       mv config.txt config.bak
       touch config.txt
